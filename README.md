## Exercise: Bank Account Balance using LinkedList in Java

#### Objective:

The objective of this exercise is to create a basic bank account balance management system using a LinkedList in Java. You will model the process of creating accounts and displaying their balances.

#### Scenario: Bank Account Balance Management

Imagine you are building a simple program to manage bank account balances. Users can create accounts and view their balances. You will implement this functionality using a LinkedList.

#### Guidelines:

1. Create a LinkedList named accountBalances to store the balances of bank accounts as doubles.
2. Implement the following methods:
    - void addAccount that adds a new account with the given initial balance to the LinkedList.
    - void displayBalances that displays the balances of all accounts in the LinkedList.
3. Create an instance of the LinkedList class in the main method 
4. Add the following account balances to the LinkedList:
    - $1000.0
    - $1500.0
    - $500.0
5. Display the account balances using the displayBalances method.
